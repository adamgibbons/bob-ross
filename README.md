# The Bob Ross Explorer ðŸŽ¨

I'm a big Bob Ross fan, and I recently came across a great [statistical analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/) on his work from FiveThirtyEight.
The accompanying data set is [available on Github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/bob-ross/elements-by-episode.csv), so I thought it'd be a fun opportunity to combine three things I love: Vue.js, Bob Ross, and data!

The finished product is available here:

## Build Setup

# install dependencies

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
